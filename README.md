# A basic webpack template for Cloud 9 Workspaces
This template provides babel (es2015), jQuery, SASS/SCSS for
a basic web app. Hot reloading is the key to
this beauty.

## Installation
Create a new workspace.
In the "Clone from Git or Mercurial URL" input,
cut and paste the URL of this repo:

> https://github.com/benjaminboruff/basic_webpack_c9

Then click the green Create Workspace button at the bottom.
Wait for the workspace to come up comletely (this may take 
a while, especially on a free account).

Then click into the bash console at the bottom of the
Cloud 9 IDE, and run:

> npm install

It will take a while for all the Node modules to download
and install. It may be possible to speed this up using
Node stable, but who am I to judge.

## Run the development server with hot reload
In the bash console run:

> npm run dev

At the top of the Cloud 9 IDE, click the
Preview button (between Support and Run) and
select Preview Running Application

Modify the files in /src and enjoy!

## Create a "production" build that can be run on a webserver

The "build" script uses a different webpack config file than
"dev". This creates a bundle.js file devoid of webpack's HRM
code that is only needed for development using the dev-server
in hot reload mode.

In the bash console run:

> npm run build

This creates an honest to goodness bundle.js file 
in /build. The bundle.js and index.html files
can now be run on the Cloud 9 Apache webserver, or downloaded
and served from any webserver.
